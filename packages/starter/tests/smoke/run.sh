# Integration smoke test for the starter theme against a real WordPress.
#
# Run from packages/starter with a started ddev project:
#
#     ./tests/smoke/run.sh
#
# This asks the one question the starter has to answer: does a project created
# from it boot and serve a page? On 2026-08-19 the answer was no, with 1409 unit
# tests passing — those run against WordPress function stubs, so a discovery that
# registers nothing at all still passes them.
#
# Everything else Foehn can do is exercised in packages/demo, which is where the
# features live. This file stays short on purpose: it is the check that has to
# keep working when the starter has almost nothing in it.
